System Requirements

Python

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido
van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code
readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.

Installation

Method 1 - Official Python Website

Step 1 -
Download the latest python (3.7.3) from the official python website by choosing the Operating
System. Install once downloaded.
URL - https://www.python.org/downloads/

Step 2 -
Copy and paste the path of the Python and Scripts folder (inside the python folder) to the
global variables.

Method 2 - Anaconda
Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages
for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment. Package
versions are managed by the package management system conda.

Step 1 -
Download anaconda from the official anaconda website.
URL - https://www.anaconda.com/

Step 2 -
Select all the necessary components such as Jupyter Notebook and other libraries that will be
mentioned in this document later.

Jupyter Notebook

Project Jupyter is a nonprofit organization created to "develop open-source software,
open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming
languages". Spun-off from IPython in 2014 by Fernando Pérez, Project Jupyter supports
execution environments in several dozen languages.

Installation

Once python has been installed and the directory’s address has been set as environment
variable -

Step 1 -
Open terminal on Linux or MacOS or Command Prompt on Windows..

Step 2 -
Type the following commands to check if Python and pip can be accessed globally -
>> python --version
>> pip --version

Step 3 -
Install jupyter-notebook using the following command.
>> pip install jupyter

Libraries

Pandas

Definition
In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming
language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and
operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under
the three-clause BSD license.

Installation
>> pip install pandas

Numpy

Definition
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large,
multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical
functions to operate on these arrays.

Installation
>> pip install numpy

Scipy

Definition
SciPy is a free and open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical
computing. SciPy contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation,
special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, ODE solvers and other tasks common in
science and engineering.

Installation
>> pip install scipy

Matplotlib

Definition
Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical
mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into
applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+

Installation
>> pip install matplotlib
